My PHP Web Server from college.

This was built in college by me and a classmate for our webserver design class.  This was built in under 16 weeks and only takes care of most of RFC 2616.

So, please do no take this as an example of how I currently code.  This is just up here for historical fun.

Running
====

Edit the file called port in same path as "server.php" and put port number you want server to run on in there.

run "php server.php" in the same directory as server.php -- and enjoy
